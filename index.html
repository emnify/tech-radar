        <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

        <p>
          The emnify Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring
            assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we are using and want to keep using in the future.</li>
          <li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we assessed and think are worth pursuing. We will to try this technology 
            where we can handle the risk.</li>
          <li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we are interested in and want to take for a test run on a small scope.</li>
          <li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technology we use or we have used and donâ€™t want to use for new initiatives anymore.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

        <p>
          The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support Engineering teams at emnify to pick the best technologies for
          new projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on
          technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape. Based on the <a
            href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a>, our Tech Radar sets out the
          changes in technologies that are interesting in software development &mdash; changes that we think our
          engineering teams should pay attention to and use in their projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>BTW, if you would like to create your own Tech Radar &mdash; Zalando has <a
              href="https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar">open sourced the code</a> to generate this
            visualization.</em>
